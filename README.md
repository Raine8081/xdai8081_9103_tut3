Wheels are related to other circle-shape object, and I was inspired by the animation of gearwheels and the drawing animation on the disk. Firstly wheels of forture looks similar of colorful disk and all of the close were very closed to each other, which inspired my to consider if the wheels could rotate with the rhythm of music with the movement of the curve next to them.

Therefore, this famour painting could turn into an voice-controlled animation that makes a abstract painting vivid and attractive.
